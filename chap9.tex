\chapter{Project Management}

\section{Planning}

The project started with full-time dedication in September 2013 and was planned to be finished by December 2nd, 2013. The first steps were to study its feasibility in terms of technology, to outline the vision and specify the requirements with CREAF. Next steps included the design and implementation of the identified major components of the solution. It would end with the infrastructure setup, testing and the writing of the current document.

\section{Cost}

The human resources involved in the project must be considered in order to forecast the costs of the project. These are an analyst who will be in charge of the Analysis and Design, a Developer who will implement the design and a System administrator who will set up the infrastructure.

Regarding the infrastructure, as it relies only on AWS free tier it will not incur in any cost. Therefore, considering these human resources and the initial planning, the overall cost is $15250\euro{}$, as detailed below.

    \textbf{Resource}  & \textbf{Cost/Hour}  & \textbf{Hours}  & \textbf{Cost} \\ \hline
    Analyst            & 40\euro{}/h         & 200             & 8000\euro{}   \\ \hline
    Developer          & 25\euro{}/h         & 250             & 6250\euro{}   \\ \hline
    SysAdmin           & 20\euro{}/h         & 50              & 1000\euro{}    \\ \hline
    \textbf{Overall}   &                     &                 & \textbf{15250\euro{}} \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Budget}

\end{table}

Besides the time spent on the different stages of the development, additional time must be considered in order to write the current document. To that end, 90 additional hours plus the $200h + 250h + 45h = 495h$ invested by these human resources must be allocated, totalling $495h + 100h = 600h$.

\section{Execution}

Unfortunately, initial planning has suffered a few setbacks during its execution. It was first delayed at the beginning of December due to my need of finding a job and the time I spent working on a technical test required for a job offer. The major delay was caused by the impact the full-time job had in the dedication time, causing the project to be nearly stopped for several weeks. Although working on it occasionally, it was not until allocating 2 hours every day and full-time dedication on weekends that the project took effectively off. As a consequence, the planning for the remaining tasks was defined as follows.

Regarding the cost, AWS free tier provided not to be enough to fulfil the needs of the required infrastructure. Using three servers exceeded the maximum of 750 hours of EC2 micro instance usage. Thus, the overall cost has been 20.27\$ so far, missing the cost of June 2014.

Moreover, another delay was encountered while executing this final planning. A disproportionately large Amazon AWS bill was received for what seemed to be either an attack on the system or a billing error. This required infrastructure to be shut down until the issue was resolved. Although having some impact, fortunately it didn't excessively affect planning.
