\chapter{Technology research}

This chapter aims to synthesize the research carried on the main knowledge areas involved in the development of this project. It analyses technologies, paradigms and different insights the design of the project is based upon. This includes the main areas of concern: Public Interface and Interoperability, Database, Real time, Web Technologies, Event logging.   

\section{Public Interface and Interoperability}

\subsection{Client devices}

IoT
Raspberry Pi, Arduino

\section{Database}

Ever growing data set, very small data units and mainly write ops.

\subsection{Relational Databases and NoSQL}

NoSQL
MongoDB most mature
pros:
- scalabiltiy (auto sharding capabilities)
- performance
- administration ease
- several new options, not very production ready, stability

cons: 
- migration from relational design 
- non-ACID
- eventual consistency (although, non achievable in a distributed system)

\section{Real Time}
for frontend redirect to web technologies

\subsection{Asynchronous Messaging Queue}
RabbitMQ
ZeroMQ

impact on client. Async app server. Reactor pattern.

\subsection{Tuple Space}
redis

\section{Web Technologies}

HTML5	
	- what is it
	- who
	- future
	- APIs: Canvas, SVG, ... particularly the ones involved in Redch

Browser vendors
	- dramatical improvement of JS engines
	- battle as new explorer engine
	- prefixed CSS properties and non-standarized prefixed APIs

	- Firefox OS, Node.js (JS in the backend), Win8 JS apps, 
	- rich applications GDocs, Chrome book
	- Towards application platform
Canvas, SVG

JS Libraries
	- to solve cross-browser issues/compatibility, old browsers. jQuery
	- D3, widely used. Standard for data visualization
	- Chart.js

	JS apps -> Redch web application 
	problem of JS apps -> old browsers. Autoupdate
	- Backbone, underscore -> Angular.js, Ember
	- full ecosystem of MVC components, templates systems, etc.

\subsection{Server Sent Events}
specification over standard HTTP. RFC

\subsection{Web Sockets}
buzzword, trend, full duplex
Too often misunderstood, lower level protocol than HTTP, whole new protocol

\section{Event Logging}
Need to get insight of the system functioning. Misbehaviour. Analysis tool.
