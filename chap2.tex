\chapter{Analysis}

\section{Requirements}
They have been obtained throughout some meetings with CREAF researcher in charge of the project.

Real use-case data (number of owners) has been obtained to "scope" the system qualities properly.

\subsection{System-Wide Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The system must be fed with the data collected by the sensor devices
	\item The system must require an authentication system for the sensor devices and the web application users
	\item The system must provide software tracing
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{System Qualities}

\subsubsection{Usability}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The web application must be user friendly and easy to use by means of a GUI
	\item The sensor devices must be easy to set up by end users
	\item The sensor device must collect and deliver data automatically
	\item All the command line interfaces must be configurable
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reliability}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The system must be reliable in low bandwidth and high network latency
	\item The system must be reliable in high concurrency scenarios
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Performance}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The sensor devices must be able to send [Y] request per hour
	\item The system must be able to process observations received from [X] sensor devices
	\item The system must able to display a sample from a certain sensor before its next sample is received
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Supportability}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The system must have an event logging system
	\item The system must conform to the OGC Sensor Observation Service (SOS)
	\item The system must be horizontally scalable
	\item The codebase must be maintainable and extendible
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Interfaces}

\subsubsection{Interfaces to External Systems}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The system must integrate 52 North SOS implementation to provide a standard interoperability layer
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The sensor devices must send 6 power observations per hour
	\item The system must be able to run in commodity servers 
	\item The whole codebase must be portable in order to be deployed in any platform including PaaS and IaaS
\end{itemize}

SOS

\subsection{System Compliance}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The system and all its components must adhere to Apache license
\end{itemize}
