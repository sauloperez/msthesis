\chapter{Technology research}

This chapter aims to synthesize the research carried on the main knowledge areas involved in the development of this project. It analyses technologies, paradigms and different insights the design of the project is based upon. This includes the main areas of concern: Public Interface and Interoperability, Database, Real time, Web Technologies, Event logging.   

\section{Public Interface and Interoperability}

\subsection{Client devices}

IoT
Raspberry Pi, Arduino

\section{Database}

Ever growing data set, very small data units and mainly write ops.

\subsection{Relational Databases and NoSQL}

NoSQL
MongoDB most mature
pros:
- scalabiltiy (auto sharding capabilities)
- performance
- administration ease
- several new options, not very production ready, stability

cons: 
- migration from relational design 
- non-ACID
- eventual consistency (although, non achievable in a distributed system)

\section{Real Time}
for frontend redirect to web technologies

\subsection{Asynchronous Messaging Queue}
RabbitMQ
ZeroMQ

impact on client. Async app server. Reactor pattern.

\subsection{Tuple Space}
redis

\section{Web Technologies}

Since the Sir Tim Berners-Lee's first draft of the World Wide Web back in 1989 and his first proposal for the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) \cite{HTMLtags} in 1991 the WWW has experienced a tremendous evolution. Since then, HTML has gone through many revisions. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) published many iterations of the standard until the specification HTML 4.01 in 1999. It was not until 2004, when the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) was founded by individuals of Apple, the Mozilla Foundation, and Opera Software, that HTML was proposed to be extended so as to allow the creation of web applications. WHATWG published the First Public Working Draft of the HTML5 specification in 2008. Although parts of HTML5 have been implemented in browsers it hadn't been until 2012 that W3C designated HTML5 as a Candidate Recommendation and it is planned to be released as a stable Recommendation by the end of 2014.


Ajax

HTML5	
	- what is it
	- who
	- future
	- APIs: Canvas, SVG, ... particularly the ones involved in Redch

Browser vendors
	- dramatical improvement of JS engines
	- battle as new explorer engine
	- prefixed CSS properties and non-standarized prefixed APIs

	- Firefox OS, Node.js (JS in the backend), Win8 JS apps, 
	- rich applications GDocs, Chrome book
	- Towards application platform
Canvas, SVG

JS Libraries
	- to solve cross-browser issues/compatibility, old browsers. jQuery
	- D3, widely used. Standard for data visualization. As being the 5th most starred repository in github, more than rails or angular.js, shows.
	- Chart.js

	JS apps -> Redch web application 
	problem of JS apps -> old browsers. Autoupdate
	- Backbone, underscore -> Angular.js, Ember
	- full ecosystem of MVC components, templates systems, etc.

\subsection{Server Sent Events}
specification over standard HTTP. RFC

\subsection{Web Sockets}
buzzword, trend, full duplex
Too often misunderstood, lower level protocol than HTTP, whole new protocol

\section{Event Logging}
Need to get insight of the system functioning. Misbehaviour. Analysis tool.
