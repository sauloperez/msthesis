%% This is an example first chapter.  You should put chapter/appendix that you
%% write into a separate file, and add a line \include{yourfilename} to
%% main.tex, where `yourfilename.tex' is the name of the chapter/appendix file.
%% You can process specific files by typing their names in at the 
%% \files=
%% prompt when you run the file main.tex through LaTeX.
\chapter{Requirements}

They have been obtained throughout some interviews with the CREAF researcher in charge of the project.

Real use-case data (number of owners) has been obtained to "scope" the system qualities properly.

\section{System-Wide Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The system must be fed with the data collected by the sensor devices
	\item The system must require an authentication system for the sensor devices and the web application users
	\item The system must provide software tracing
\end{itemize}

\section{System Qualities}

\subsection{Usability}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The system must be user friendly and easy to use by means of a GUI
	\item The sensor devices must be easy to set up by end users
	\item The sensor device must collect and deliver the data automatically
	\item All the command line interfaces must be scriptable and configurable
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reliability}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The system must be reliable in low bandwidth and high network latency
	\item The system must be reliable in high-load scenarios
	\item The system must be reliable in high user concurrency scenarios
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The system must able to show new available data in the real time visualization before the next observation is sent from the sensor device
	\item The system must be able to process observations received from [X] sensor devices
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Supportability}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The system must have some sort of event logging system
	\item The system must support SOS standard in order to be interoperable
	\item The system must be horizontally scalable
	\item The codebase must be maintainable and extendible
\end{itemize}

\section{System Interfaces}

\subsection{Interfaces to External Systems}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The system must integrate 52 North SOS implementation to provide a standard interoperability layer
\end{itemize}

\section{System Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The sensor devices must send [X] power observations within an hour
	\item The system must be able to run in commodity servers 
	\item The software must be portable in order to be deployed in any platform including PaaS and IaaS
\end{itemize}

SOS

\section{System Compliance}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The system and all its components must adhere to [Open Source license] license
\end{itemize}
